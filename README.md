# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a customer churn prediction project focused on Syriatel, a telecommunications company. Customer churn, or attrition, is the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company. Predicting customer churn is a critical task for businesses to retain customers and maintain profitability.

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict which Syriatel customers are likely to churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

# Data Source
The data used in this project was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset], and it includes information about Syriatel customers. The dataset contains various features, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and historical churn information.

# Project Goals
## The main objectives of this project are as follows:

* Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
* Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
* Create and engineer relevant features for modeling.
* Build and evaluate machine learning models for customer churn prediction.
* Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model results.

# Data Exploration
In the data exploration phase, we analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables. We visualized key insights to identify patterns and potential factors influencing customer churn.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is essential to prepare the data for modeling. It involves handling missing values, outliers, and transforming categorical variables. Additionally, data scaling and splitting into training and testing sets are performed.

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for creating informative variables that can improve model performance. This step involves the creation of new features, such as customer tenure, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

# Modeling
We employed machine learning techniques, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and K Nearest Neighbour , to build predictive models for customer churn. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning were performed to optimize model performance.

# Evaluation
The models' performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. We also visualized the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves. The model with the best performance was selected as our final churn prediction model.

# Conclusion
This project aims to provide Syriatel with a predictive model to identify potential churners. By taking proactive measures with at-risk customers, the company can reduce customer churn and improve customer retention, ultimately leading to increased profitability.
